\begin{abstract}%{{{%
Concurrent programming is notoriously difficult, but with multi-core
processors becoming the norm, it is now a reality that every programmer must
face. Concurrency has traditionally been managed using low-level
mutual exclusion \emph{locks}, which are error-prone and do not naturally
support the compositional style of programming that is becoming
indispensable for today's large-scale software projects.

A novel, high-level approach that has emerged in recent years is that of
\emph{software transactional memory} (STM), which avoids the need for
explicit locking, instead presenting the programmer with a declarative
approach to concurrency. However, its implementation is much more complex
and subtle, and ensuring its correctness places significant demands on the
compiler writer.

In this thesis we consider the problem of formally verifying a compiler for
software transactional memory. Based on a minimal language, we first explore
various design choices along with the issue of compiler correctness via the
use of automated testing tools. We then develop a new approach to concurrent
compiler correctness using the notion of bisimulation, implemented using the
Agda theorem prover. Finally, we apply this approach to our minimal language
to give the first formally verified compiler for software transactional
memory.
