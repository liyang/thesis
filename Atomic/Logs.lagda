Before we give the log-based semantics for |atomic| blocks, let us first
define what transaction logs are. Recall from chapter \ref{ch:model} that we
modelled them as partial maps from variables to numbers, where an entry for
a variable exists only when it has been read from or written to. We take
a similar approach to |Heap|s, using vectors of |Maybe ℕ|\footnote{For
aesthetic reasons I have renamed the |nothing| and |just| constructors of
|Maybe| to |○| and |●| respectively.} initialised to |○|:
%{
%format ρ = "\name{\rho}"
%format ω = "\name{\omega}"
\begin{code}
record Logs : Set where
  constructor _&_
  field
    ρ {-"\;"-} ω : Vec (Maybe ℕ) ∣Heap∣

∅ : Logs
∅ = Vec.replicate ○ & Vec.replicate ○
\end{code}
The |ρ| and |ω| fields of a |Logs| record correspond to the read and write
logs of chapter \ref{ch:model}, and are used in an identical manner to keep
track of variables during a running transaction.

%format Write = "\func{Write}"
The rule for writing to a transaction variable is the simplest of the two,
and is implemented by a |Write| function that returns a new pair of logs
with the entry for |v| in |ω| updated to the new value |m|.
\begin{code}
Write : Logs → Variable → ℕ → Logs
Write (ρ & ω) v m = ρ & ω « v »≔ ● m
\end{code}

%format Read = "\func{Read}"
The |Read| function on the other hand takes a heap, a pair of logs and
a variable as arguments, and returns a potentially modified read log along
with the in-transaction value of the variable:
\begin{code}
Read : Heap → Logs → Variable → Logs × ℕ
Read h (ρ & ω) v with Vec.lookup v ω
... |  ● m = ρ & ω , m
... |  ○ with Vec.lookup v ρ
...    | ● m = ρ & ω , m
...    | ○ = ρ « v »≔ ● m & ω , m where m = Vec.lookup v h
\end{code}
If a variable has been written to according to |ω|, we immediately return
the new value. Otherwise we consult the read log |ρ|: if a previous value
for |v| exists, we return that. In both cases the transaction logs remain
unchanged. Only when no cached value for |v| exists---that is, we are
reading a variable for the first time---do we update the read log |ρ| with
the value of |v| from the current heap. Note that with this definition of
|Read|, if a variable is written to before it is read, the corresponding
read log entry will never be filled.
